README: JDBC MYSQL COURSE SOURCE CODE
=====================================

This directory contains all of the source code used in the course.

Setting up the Code
-------------------

1. In Eclipse, import the project for your desired lecture
	- For example, you can import files from the directory
	- lecture-03-setting-up-dev-environment/jdbc-test

2. Run the database setup script
	- Each lecture has a specific database setup script
	- You must run this before running the application
	
	- The script is located in the “sql” subdirectory of each lecture
	- For example with lecture 3, you will find it here:
	- lecture-03-setting-up-dev-environment/jdbc-test/sql/table-setup.sql
	
	- You can run the SQL script using a SQL tool such as MySQL Workbench 

3. Change the database connection info
	- In the source code, update the database URL, user id and password for your local environment

4. Finally, run the program in Eclipse

If you have any questions, please post them in the class discussion forum.
