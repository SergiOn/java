The Intermediate Class Introduction

The Intermediate Class
This Intermediate Class is organized in 3 different modules:

Consuming the API from AngularJS (5 lessons)
Testing the API (5 lessons)
Advanced API Security (6 lessons)
Each Module is organized in several video Lessons - each containing lesson notes and resources. 
The Lessons are meant to be experienced as video lessons, and the notes should be used as a reference not as comprehensive documentation.


The Project Code
The user management project has 6 sub-lessons in the Starter Class (in the later classes, it's going to have 5-6):

common-client - holds common, generic infrastructure to build a client for the REST API
common-test - holds common testing infrastructure that it not domain specific
common - holds common, generic infrastructure (utilities, abstract classes, etc) that are not domain specific
um-client - holds the actual domain-specific client logic
um-ui - holds the simple front-end app
um-webapp - holds the actual, domain specific REST API
