Intermediate Class: Outro


Update:

API Security is the one topic I get the most questions on - not only within the course, but in general, from all Baeldung readers.

And the students of the course have also requested some advanced and definitely interesting topics as well. Things like:

What's the right OAuth2 flow to use in a REST API and why?
How do I set up a proxy and can that help with token storage and security?
What about CORS and the single origin constraint? Is the Zuul proxy (from Netflix) a good solution for that?
Can you show me some actual Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and how the new CSRF Protection in Spring Security helps?
What about a project template that already has a good proxy implementation and is ready to use?
Lot's of good stuff here.

So I'm pulling code out of a few client implementations and working on this 2 hour long live workshop - where I'm basically going to lay it all out there.

I'm going to go through all of these and show you how to do the implementation of each.
Here's the live workshop:

The "Advanced API Security" Workshop ( 129$ )
