1. Goals
The goal of this lesson is to explain a simple way of exposing some basic metrics from your web application.


2. Lesson Notes
First - the actual data collection and storage is done automatically by Spring Boot. 
We're only adding a thin layer on top of the Boot APIs here, and exposing to the client - via a simple controller.

Our thin service - the ActuatorMetricService - is a simple and in-memory implementation that gets the last minute of metrics from the Boot PublicMetrics API. 
It creates a new list, filled with 0 values, each corresponding to an HTTP status code and fills in the values.

Obviously this is an example implementation, with a few notable issues:

memory leaks (the list of metrics isn't cleared at any point)
no persistence (metrics are lost on restart)
Despite the shortcomings (or because of them) - it's a very good place to start.
