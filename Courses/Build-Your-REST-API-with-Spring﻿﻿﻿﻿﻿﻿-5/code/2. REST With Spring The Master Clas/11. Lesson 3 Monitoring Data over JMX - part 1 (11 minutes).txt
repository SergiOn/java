1. Goals
The goal of this lesson is simple - to take you through the basics of profiling your running API and reading the JMX data it exposes. 

2. Lesson Notes
To prepare your VisualVM installation, install the VisualVM-MBeans plugin.

Here are some interesting MBeans on your Tomcat system:

in the Spring Boot package - we have an MBean for each endpoint
in Catalina -> ThreadPool (connectionCount, currentThreadCount, currentThreadBusy, keepAliceCount)
in Catalina -> GlobalRequestProcessor
in Catalina -> Manager -> localhost
in Catalina -> ProtocolHandler - 8082 (connection count)
in Catalina -> Servlet -> dispatcherServlet
Note: you can double click on bolder values to get a nice graph representation
