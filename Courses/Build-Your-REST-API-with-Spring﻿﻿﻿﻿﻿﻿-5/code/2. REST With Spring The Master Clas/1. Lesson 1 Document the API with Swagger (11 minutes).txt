1. Module 7 Overview
The goal of this module is to teach you about making an API fully Hypermedia enabled and evolving it once it goes into production (with minimal impact to clients).

Hypermedia and HATEOAS are foundational pieces of REST, and the tactics of API evolution are ultimately critical once the API starts to be used by third-party clients. This is what thismodule is focused on.


2. Goals
The goal of this lesson is to guide you through choosing the best way of documenting the API and then through a full Swagger setup within our Spring project implementation.

Everything should be fully documented with the nice Swagger UI by the end.
