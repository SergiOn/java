1. Goals
In this lesson you're going to learn how to take your existing, simple CI pipeline to the next level with a Continuous Delivery that can allow you to deploy to production.


2. Lesson Notes
What makes up a CD pipeline?
Here are the common jobs that usually make up a CD pipeline:

A UI testing job - only if the REST API is deployed alongside a UI application
A Performance job - this might use JMeter or Gatling
A Release job

What are the next steps to production?
Finally, there are a few aspects of building out a full, mature CD pipeline that we haven't touched on, but are definitely worth exploring:

Parallelizing a set of jobs in the pipeline in conjunction with a join-point
Recording fingerprints on build artifacts to then determine which artifacts were used by which jobs in the pipeline
Setting up a manual approval process / gate before actually deploying to production
Auditing job configuration changes
Displaying the entire pipeline using a custom v
