1. Goals
This lesson focuses on making the HATEOAS implementation easier with the help of the Spring HATEOAS project. 

2. Lesson Notes
Spring HATEOAS will help us wrap our existing Resources/DTOs and provide extra metadata back to the client of the API.

The main type of metadata that we're going to set up is links (along with link relations).


We start the implementation with a simple HATEOAS enabeld controller - the RoleHateoasControllerSimple. 
And the fully implemented controller - RoleHateoasController - is the final point of the implementation. 

Note that the codebase has been upgraded to a newer version of spring-hateoas (0.19.0.RELEASE) - which no longer returns an empty link array. Now, when no link is defined, the links array is simply not part of the response.
