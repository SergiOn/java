1. Goals
The goal of this lesson is to show you how to approach the implementation of an async REST API, for a long-running operation. 

2. Lesson Notes
2.1. Overview of the 3 Solutions

The operation we’re going to use to test-drive this is the creation of a User resource. 
There are several options we can use to do that:

first, we’ll look at using the Callable functional interface to make the processing of the request async
then we’ll have a quick look at DeferredResult - the Spring alternative to Callable
and finally - we’ll have a look at a truly async implementation - using the @Async annotation

First, let’s create (or simulate) our slow operation. We’re going to take our existing create user operation and add a sleep next to it:

@Override
public UserDto createSlow(final UserDto dto) {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(AsyncService.DELAY);
        return create(dto);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

2.2. Using Callable
First, let’s create the simple operation: 
@RequestMapping(value = "/callable", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
@ResponseBody
public Callable<UserDto> createUserWithCallable(@RequestBody UserDto resource) {
    return new Callable<UserDto>() {
        @Override
        public UserDto call() throws Exception {
            return service.createSlow(resource);
        }
    };
}
Notice how the implementation is simply wrapping the actual service call in the Callable.

Also notice we’re baking in a delay - the goal there is to simulate a longer running operation. 
OK, so what happens when this API gets called: 
first, it gets picked up by a Servlet container thread
then, because the return value is Callable - Spring MVC will process that callable in a separate thread
the Servlet container thread immediately exits and so it’s able to pick up a new request
and the new new Spring MVC thread does our internal processing
when that’s done - the result is going to be dispatched back to the container to finish and return to the client
Note that this is all making use of the Async functionality in Servlet 3. 
As you might have noticed already, this is indeed releasing the Servlet thread earlier and not keeping it blocked with a long running operation.

But, the client is still blocked for the entire duration of the operation, just as if we had a fully synchronous operation. 
Finally, let’s write a quick live test to see that in action: 
@Test
public void whenCreateUserAsyncUsingCallable_thenCreatedWithDelay() {
    Response response = createRandomUser().post(getApi().getUri() + "/callable");
    assertEquals(201, response.getStatusCode());
    assertNotNull(response.jsonPath().get("name"));
    assertTrue(response.time() > AsyncService.DELAY);
}
Notice the final assertion - and specifically the response time - we can clearly see that the client is going to wait more than the delay (10 seconds) the processing takes. 
And so, there is clearly an internal advantage of using this pattern and using Callable to split the processing of a longer task - but from the POV of the client, the operation is still blocking


2.3. Using DeferredResult
The DeferredResult implementation has the same goal - to release the Servlet thread while a long-running operation is processing.

So it’s important to understand that the operation will still be blocking for the client - just like our Callable example. 
Let’s start with the API operation:

@RequestMapping(value = "/deferred", method = RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
@ResponseBody
public DeferredResult<UserDto> createUserWithDeferredResult(@RequestBody UserDto resource) {
    DeferredResult<UserDto> result = new DeferredResult<UserDto>();
    asyncService.scheduleCreateUser(resource, result);
    return result;
}
Let's see exactly what's going on here:

first, we create our deferred result
and we pass that into the service
then we simply return it - so that the container thread can exit right away
The one key difference between this and our previous implementation with Callable is that - here - we have full control over setting the value on that deferred result.

Let's now implement the service layer: 
public void scheduleCreateUser(UserDto resource, DeferredResult<UserDto> deferredResult) {
    CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> userService.createSlow(resource))
      .whenCompleteAsync((result, throwable) -> deferredResult.setResult(result));
}
This is definitely an interesting implementation.

First - we’re using the very nice supplyAsync API to run our slow creation logic asynchronously.

We’re then passing in an action that’s going to run when the logic finishes - and in that action, we're setting the result of the deferred result (remember we need to do that ourselves now)
We can finally implement a live test that's very similar to the one we used previously. 

Finally, we're going to discuss the third and final implementation - using the @Async annotation - in the next part of the lesson.
