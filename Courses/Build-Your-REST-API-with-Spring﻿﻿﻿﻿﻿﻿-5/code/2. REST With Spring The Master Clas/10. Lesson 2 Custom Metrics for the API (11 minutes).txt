1. Goals
The goal of this lesson is to go deeper into Actuators and Spring Boot, and learn how to customize things.

We are going to implement a custom health check for the /health endpoint and we are going to track custom metrics, for the /metrics endpoint. 

2. Lesson Notes
2.1. A Custom Health-Check
A custom health-check is implemented as an ordinary bean (@Component) implementing the HealthIndicator interface.

To construct the Health response, we can use the simple, fluent API; here are a few examples:

Health.up().build()

Health.down().build()

Health.down().outOfService().build()


2.2. Track Custom Metrics
To track a custom metric, we'll need to inject the CounterService out of Spring Boot and simply use it to increment the reading of the metrics we're tracking (by key).

Here's a simple example:

counterService.increment("service.privilege.findByName");

2.3. Export Metrics
Accessing the metrics of the system via the /metrics endpoint is a good place to start, but - for a production system - it's really not enough.

We need to export these internal metrics to a third-party metrics system - that's specifically build to track and work with metric data, and that is entirely independent of the main API application (such as the ELK stack - Elasticsearch, Logstack, Kibana)

To build a Metrics exported - we'll simply use the @Scheduled support from Spring and export our data on a given cadence, from a MetricRepository bean that we can simply inject and use.


2.4. Metrics from Dropwizard
The Metrics library from Dropwizard is very well integrated into Spring Boot, so it's using the Spring Boot metrics support isn't enough for a mode advanced usecase. 

2.4. Spring Boot Version
Note that the lesson is using Spring Boot 1.2.x.

If you're planning to use a later version, there are a few changes that you should be aware of: 
in MetricsExporter.java, replace the autowired MetricRepository with BufferMetricReader and inject the CounterService to reset the metrics
BufferMetricReader conflicts with Dropwizard's MetricRegistry; remove the injection of BufferMetricReader
