1. Goals
In this lesson you'll learn how to set up a simple Continuous Integration Jenkins pipeline for a REST API.


2. Lesson Notes
The Live Job
Similar to the integration tests and the integration profile, we're going to use a separate live profile to run the suite of live tests.

The surefire configuration will of course be similar as well - including the live tests by name and excluding everything else.

The main difference in this live profile is that - in order to be able to run the live tests - we need a running server where the API is deployed.

So - in order to achieve that, we'll use the Maven Cargo plugin to start up an embedded Tomcat 8 server in the pre-integration-test phase of the Maven build, and then to stop it in the post-integration-phase.

This solution enables us to start the API before the live tests run, execute the suite of live tests, and then stop that server.



Configuring Cargo and Surefire
We need Cargo to start up the embedded server on different ports and not use the defaults:

<cargo.servlet.port>8082</cargo.servlet.port>
<cargo.tomcat.ajp.port>8010</cargo.tomcat.ajp.port>
<cargo.rmi.port>8006</cargo.rmi.port>
This is simply in case the defaults are already in use on that box - both on your local environment and on Jenkins itself, the default ports are likely already in use. 
Then, we need to make sure that Surefire runs the live tests against the correct port - 8082 in this case. So, we're going to use the exact same mechanism as we did in the integration profile - setting a property:

<webTarget>cargo</webTarget>
That will simply configure the live tests to use `web-cargo.properties` - which is of course using the right port: 
http.port=8082

Chaining the Jobs
Each job in the pipeline needs to be configured to trigger the execution of the next job (if stable): 
A Job -> Configure -> Post Build Actions: 
- Build other projects - select the next job in the pipeline (Trigger only if build is stable)


Finally, note that the 2 failing tests we used to show how a failing test looks in the build are of course ignored in the codebase.
