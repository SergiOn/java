1. Module 8 Overview
This module is all about monitoring your API and tracking good, useful metrics from the start.

It's also a Spring Boot heavy lesson - mainly because the framework makes the Ops story a lot better and saves us time and effort in having to implement this low level support ourselves. And while this isn't a Spring Boot focused module, we do want to use the best tool for the job.


2. Goals
Learn how Spring Boot makes monitoring and tracking the metrics of a Spring API very easy. 

3. Lesson Notes
We are going to use Spring Boot actuators to start tracking metrics and expose these via several endpoints:

/info
/health
/metrics
We are also going to configure these endpoints via application.properties:

- "endpoints.{endpointname}.{option}" - with the following options:

id
sensitive
enabled
- ex: endpoints.health.sensitive=false
- other endpoint related options can be configured as well: 
management.context-path = actuators
management.port = 8081
/info endpoint configuration
info.app.name = My App
info.build.version = @project.version@ 
Note how we are using the @@ syntax here to get the value of the property from the pom of the parent (after maven runs package)
URLs for a local deployment
http://localhost:8081/api/management/info

http://localhost:8081/api/management/metrics

Note that the assumptions here is that the deployment happens via Spring Boot (where the port is already configured to 8081 and the app will be deployed at the root). If deployment happens in a standard Tomcat server, then these URLs will be slightly different.
