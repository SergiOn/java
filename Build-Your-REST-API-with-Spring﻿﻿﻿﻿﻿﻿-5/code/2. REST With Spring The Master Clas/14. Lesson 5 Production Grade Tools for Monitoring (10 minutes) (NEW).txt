1. Goals
This lesson aims to give you a surface level understanding of some of the widely used production grade tools available for monitoring a web application. 

2. Lesson Notes
2.1. Free / Open Source Tools
CollectD + Graphite (Graphana)

This is a visualization tool for monitoring metrics in your application, with a very powerful querying API, but an old looking UI and some scaling issues.

The ELK Stack = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana
This set of open source tools delivers search & analytics, logging, and visualization capabilities.

The 3 components are built to integrate well together and can scale quite well.

Kibana also has a very mature, flexible and modern looking UI.


2.2. Paid Tools
And on the paid side of things, we have 3 major players in the APM (Application Performance Monitoring) space:

Appdynamics
Newrelic
Dynatrace
