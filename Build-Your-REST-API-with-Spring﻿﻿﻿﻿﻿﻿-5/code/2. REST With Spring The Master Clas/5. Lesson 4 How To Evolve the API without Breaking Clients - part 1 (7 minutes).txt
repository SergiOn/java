1. Goals
This lesson focuses on a critical aspect of a good REST API - evolving the API without breaking clients. 

2. Lesson Notes
Manage Change in REST
- any and all APIs will - at some point - need to change

- the bad: there aren’t a whole lot of options to manage change in REST

- the good: not many things you have to worry about

- the main goal - when considering any API change - is maintaining full backwards compatibility for existing client; after a new release, clients should work smoothly and without any changes, taking advantage of new features at their convenience

Why not just version your API?
- Versioning has a few downsides:

leads to an explosion of the URL surface area of the API
is disruptive to clients
is complex to maintain long-term
Anticipate Change
- a very important tenant to communicate to all clients from day 1:

Ignore any unexpected data in the interaction with the API

- that means that clients can never assume that they have a complete picture of what they will find in a response from the API

Types of Changes
- Adding data to a Resource

- Changing the Type of data in a Resource

- Changing the Structure of a Field in a Resource

- Removing data from a Resource

- Splitting one Resource into two

- Changing the URL of an existing Resource
