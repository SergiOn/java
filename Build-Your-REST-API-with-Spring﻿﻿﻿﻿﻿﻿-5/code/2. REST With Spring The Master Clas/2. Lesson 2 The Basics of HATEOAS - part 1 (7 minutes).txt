1. Goals
This lesson is focused on a very interesting and often overlooked part of REST - Hypermedia and the HATEOAS constraint. 

2. Lesson Notes
What is HATEOAS
- stands for "Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State"

- HATEOAS is one of the architectural constraints in the REST architecture

Theory vs Practice
- in theory, a REST API should not need any documentation to be consumed by clients; that’s considered “out-of-band” information

- however, the self-documenting API concept is making some assumption about the level of standardization and adoption in the market - which is not where it needs to be for a self-documenting API to be feasible in practice

- does that mean that HATEOAS is not useful? no - it’s super useful, it just doesn’t replace documentation
HATEOAS - The Manual Way
Spring enables us to inject the HTTP Response in any method in the Controller layer.

That theoretically enables us to adhere to the HATEOAS constraint with a fully manual implementation.
