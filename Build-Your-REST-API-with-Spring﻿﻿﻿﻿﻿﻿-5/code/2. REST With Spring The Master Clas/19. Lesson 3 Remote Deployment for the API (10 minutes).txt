1. Goals
In this lesson you're going to learn how to set up a remote deployment process of the API into an external Tomcat server. 

2. Lesson Notes
We're going to define a new deploy Maven profile for this new Cargo configuration with support for remote deployments.

There are two aspects to this configuration:

The Cargo Maven configuration
The external instance running the Tomcat Server
And of course these two needs to match up. 
2.1. The Cargo Maven configuration
High level - here's what the Cargo configuration looks like:

the container needs to be type = remote
the runtime configuration needs to define the cargo.hostname, cargo.servlet.port etc - to match the remote Tomcat server
the deployer needs to be type = remote
and we need to explicitly define the deployable - the war that we're going to be remote deploying
2.2. The External Tomcat Server
We can set up the Tomcat server on a separate EC2 instance, just as we did with Jenkins.

Of course most of that process - documented in Lesson 1 of this module - is identical - up until downloading the Jenkins war. 
In addition to setting up the Tomcat server, we also need to configure some extra security now - to support the remote deployment:

vim $TOMCAT_INSTALL_DIR/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
And add in: 
<role rolename="manager" />
<user username="manager" password="manager" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status" />
A very quick note here is that manager/manager are - of course - just example credentials which you'll definitely want to change in practice.
