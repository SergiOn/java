1. Goals
In this lesson you'll learn how to set up a simple Continuous Integration Jenkins pipeline for a REST API.


2. Lesson Notes
The Build and Unit Test Job
By default, the maven configuration - specifically the Surefire plugin - is configured to only run unit tests (integration and live tests are skipped in the default run).

Tests can be easily identified by name when the follow a very simple naming convention:

unit tests: ...UnitTest.java
integration tests: ...IntegrationTest.java
live tests: ...LiveTest.java
As a result, the first Jenkins job executes the build and the Unit tests.

A quick final note here is that - the granularity of jobs is very important in a pipeline.

A general rule of thumb is that jobs should be fine-grained and focus on one thing. This initial job doesn't exactly adhere to that rule - because it's doing 2 things - the build, and running the unit tests. That's because our codebase is still quite simple - but in a more complex codebase, you can separate these into 2 separate jobs. 

The Integration Job
The suite of integration tests is separated into a Maven profile, where the Surefire plugin is configured to include these tests.

The Surefire plugin also allows us to set a system property for that run:

<persistenceTarget>test</persistenceTarget>
That allows us to select another `persistence-${persistenceTarget}.properties` file for this run (persistence-test.properties) - which uses the H2 in memory database instead of the default MySQL.
