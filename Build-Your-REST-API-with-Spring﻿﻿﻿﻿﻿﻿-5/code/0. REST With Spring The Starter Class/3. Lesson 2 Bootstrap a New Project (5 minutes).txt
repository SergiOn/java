1. Goal
Create a working Spring application from scratch and learn how to do a simple IDE deployment of this new application.


2. Lesson Notes
Before we start using our main course codebase, let's first take a few minutes to understand how to bootstrap a new project from scratch. 
Even though this isn't going to be our main codebase here, it's still important to be able to set up a new project quickly using Spring Initializr.


Define a Server in Eclipse

Window -> Preferences -> Server - Runtime Environments
