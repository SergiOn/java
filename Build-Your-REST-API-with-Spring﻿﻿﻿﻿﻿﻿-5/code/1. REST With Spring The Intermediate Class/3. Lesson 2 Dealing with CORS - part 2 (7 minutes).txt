1. Goal
Continue learning about and understand the Same Origin Policy restriction of the browser, CORS and how to relax that restriction in Spring. 

2. Lesson Notes
Note that, when we focus on the new @CrossOrigin annotation here in the lesson - the filter presented before has been removed (it's not needed if we use the new support).
